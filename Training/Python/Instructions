Hey guys! 
Welcome to Stage 2 of our qSTP project. This part will focus on us developing
our Python skills. 

Since I am a little busy in Pune, I am being cheap and putting txt files now.
Please bear with me.

Next, the method for this section. There is a pdf file called Learn Python the Hard Way, by far one of the best books on Python. Now, I will issue assignments to you guys, one in each folder and you have to finish it. The filename should be Assignment1_YOURNAME. 

You can either read the book and then attempt the assignment or if you think you are ahead, you can finish the assignmentS which are later. 

This is important. Push your files to your remote! Please make sure you do this or I won't get your files.

I am a strict believer in the Honor Code. Yeah yeah, I might sound very old fashioned. But for anyone interested, look up the Stanford Honor Code. It's one rule. Collaborate, do not copy. So please, I request you guys to collaborate, help each other out but don't copy. Helps no one. 

Finally, post all doubts on the Google Hangout, no private messaging. Everyone gets to see the doubt and it might even help them out. 

Okay, get started. And all the best.
